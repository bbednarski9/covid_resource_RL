## Abstract

Objective: This work investigates how reinforcement learning and deep learning models can facilitate the nearoptimal redistribution of medical equipment in order to bolster public health responses to future crises similar
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Materials and Methods: The system presented is simulated with disease impact statistics from the Institute of
Health Metrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Census Bureau. We present a robust pipeline
for data preprocessing, future demand inference, and a redistribution algorithm that can be adopted across
broad scales and applications.
Results: The reinforcement learning redistribution algorithm demonstrates performance optimality ranging
from 93% to 95%. Performance improves consistently with the number of random states participating in exchange, demonstrating average shortage reductions of 78.74 +/- 30.8% in simulations with 5 states to 93.50 +/-
0.003% with 50 states.
Conclusions: These findings bolster confidence that reinforcement learning techniques can reliably guide resource allocation for future public health emergencies.
